/**
 * Hello challenger! Your task is to write a function named `numberCompareFunction` which takes in 2 numbers and checks if they are the same
 *
 * Your implementation should handle two numbers which are the same
 *
 * A few examples:
 *    `numberCompareFunction(2, 2) should return true
 *    `numberCompareFunction(2, 3) should return false
 *    `numberCompareFunction("Hello", "HelloAgain") should return false
 */
