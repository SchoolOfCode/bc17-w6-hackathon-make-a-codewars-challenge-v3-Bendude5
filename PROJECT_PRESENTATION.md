Plan: To create a code test to check if 2 numbers are the same, there would then be a bonus task to create a FizzBuzz style game

Story: I am a simple programmer, on a journey to create something amazing!... so heres a basic number task lol

How to do it:
Start of with the numberCompare script, this will have you fill out the numberCompareFunction function,
if both numbers are the same, it should return true, if not then false.
If a string is entered then return text saying "Please enter a valid number!"

Bonus task:
After completing the first one, comment out the code inside the function to not interfere with the next one.
Now go into bonusTaskFizzBuzz, edit the function to make it print numbers from 1 to 100. For multiples of 3,
print "Fizz" instead of the number. For multiples of 5, print "Buzz."
For numbers which are multiples of both three and five, print "FizzBuzz."
